# Enhanced Error Reporting for Planning Mode - Complete

## Feature Overview

Enhanced the agent planning mode with comprehensive error reporting that displays detailed command execution information, error messages, and debugging suggestions when tasks fail. This makes troubleshooting much easier for developers.

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Step Execution Failure Reporting

**Location:** `PlanningService.java:328-329`

**Enhancement:**
```java
} else {
    System.out.println("❌ Step failed: " + completedTask.getErrorMessage());
    printDetailedFailureInfo(actionSpec, completedTask);  // NEW: Detailed analysis
}
```

**Function:** `printDetailedFailureInfo()` - Lines 2513-2579

Provides comprehensive failure analysis with:
- **Action Type and Description** 
- **Parameters Used** (command, file_path, working_directory, etc.)
- **Task Status and Error Messages**
- **Exit Codes and Command Output**
- **Commands Actually Executed**
- **Error Details from Task Result**

### 2. Subtask Evaluation Failure Reporting

**Location:** `PlanningService.java:435-437`

**Enhancement:**
```java
// If the subtask failed, print detailed failure information
if (!success) {
    printSubtaskFailureDetails(subTask, actionResult, response);  // NEW: Comprehensive report
}
```

**Function:** `printSubtaskFailureDetails()` - Lines 2585-2671

Provides detailed subtask failure analysis with:
- **Subtask Information** (description, priority, complexity)
- **Action Execution Results** (success/failure status)
- **AI Evaluation Results** (AI assessment of task completion)
- **Combined Failure Analysis** (categorizes failure types)
- **Execution Details** (command output, exit codes)
- **Debugging Suggestions** (manual commands to try, dependency checks)

## Error Report Examples

### Step Execution Failure Report

When a command execution fails, you'll now see:

```
❌ Step failed: Command execution failed with exit code 1
🔍 Detailed Failure Analysis:
├─ Action Type: SHELL_COMMAND
├─ Action Description: Install Express dependencies for the backend
├─ Parameters:
│  ├─ Command: 'npm install express sqlite3 cors'
│  ├─ Working Directory: './todo-app-backend'
├─ Task Status: FAILED
├─ Error Message: Command execution failed with exit code 1
├─ Exit Code: 1
├─ Command Output:
│  ├─ npm ERR! code ENOENT
│  ├─ npm ERR! syscall open
│  ├─ npm ERR! path /Users/user/todo-app-backend/package.json
│  └─ npm ERR! errno -2
├─ Commands Executed:
│  └─ 'npm install express sqlite3 cors'
├─ Error Details: Command execution failed with exit code 1
└─ [End Failure Analysis]
```

### Subtask Failure Report

When a subtask fails evaluation, you'll see:

```
🚨 SUBTASK FAILURE REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════
📋 Subtask: Install backend dependencies for Express and SQLite
🔧 Priority: CRITICAL
⚡ Complexity: SIMPLE

🎯 Action Execution Result:
├─ Action Success: ❌ NO
├─ Action Description: Install Express dependencies for the backend
├─ Task ID: action-1750333279266

🤖 AI Evaluation:
├─ AI Assessment: ❌ NEEDS MORE WORK
├─ AI Response: "The npm install command failed because package.json doesn't exist"

📊 Failure Analysis:
├─ Issue Type: Both action execution and AI evaluation failed
├─ Severity: HIGH - Complete task failure

🔍 Execution Details:
├─ Command Output:
│  ├─ npm ERR! code ENOENT
│  ├─ npm ERR! syscall open
│  ├─ npm ERR! path /Users/user/todo-app-backend/package.json
│  └─ npm ERR! errno -2
├─ Exit Code: 1 (ERROR)

💡 Debugging Suggestions:
├─ Try running commands manually:
│  └─ npm install express sqlite3 cors
├─ Check if file path is accessible: todo-app-backend/package.json
├─ Verify dependencies completed: subtask-1, subtask-2
└─ Consider checking working directory and permissions

═══════════════════════════════════════
```

## Failure Type Classification

### High Severity Failures

1. **Complete Task Failure**: Both action execution and AI evaluation failed
   - **Cause**: Technical issues (missing files, permission errors, etc.)
   - **Action**: Fix underlying technical problem

2. **Technical Execution Problem**: Action failed but AI would have approved
   - **Cause**: Command errors, file system issues, missing dependencies
   - **Action**: Check command syntax, file paths, and system requirements

### Medium Severity Failures

3. **Quality/Completeness Issue**: Action succeeded but AI evaluation failed
   - **Cause**: Task completed but didn't meet requirements
   - **Action**: Review task goals and improve implementation

## Debugging Information Provided

### 1. Command Details
- **Exact command executed**
- **Working directory used**
- **All parameters passed to the command**
- **Exit code returned**

### 2. Output Analysis
- **Complete command output** (first 10 lines for readability)
- **Error messages from stderr**
- **System-level error codes**

### 3. Context Information
- **Subtask priority and complexity**
- **Task dependencies and order**
- **File paths being accessed**
- **Expected vs actual outcomes**

### 4. Actionable Suggestions
- **Manual commands to test**
- **File accessibility checks**
- **Dependency verification steps**
- **Permission and directory guidance**

## Benefits for Developers

### 1. **Faster Debugging**
- See exact commands that failed
- Get immediate error context
- Understand failure root causes

### 2. **Better Error Understanding**
- Clear categorization of failure types
- Severity assessment for prioritization
- Specific technical vs quality issues

### 3. **Actionable Guidance**
- Manual testing suggestions
- File system checks to perform
- Dependency resolution steps

### 4. **Complete Context**
- Full parameter visibility
- Command output preservation
- Task relationship awareness

## Integration with Existing Features

### Maintains Current Success Reporting
✅ **Successful tasks** still show:
```
✅ Step completed successfully
📤 Output: Dependencies installed successfully
```

### Enhanced Failure Reporting
❌ **Failed tasks** now show comprehensive analysis instead of just:
```
❌ Step failed: Command execution failed
```

### Logging Integration
- All error details are also logged at appropriate levels
- Debug logs contain full technical details
- User output shows formatted, readable information

## Testing the Enhanced Error Reporting

### Intentional Test Failures

To test the enhanced error reporting, you can create scenarios like:

1. **Missing Directory**:
   ```
   command=npm install express, working_directory=./nonexistent-folder
   ```

2. **Invalid Command**:
   ```
   command=npm install invalidpackagename12345
   ```

3. **Permission Issues**:
   ```
   command=mkdir /restricted-folder
   ```

### Expected Output Features

✅ **Command visibility** - See exactly what was attempted
✅ **Error categorization** - Understand if it's technical or quality issue
✅ **Output preservation** - Full error messages from commands
✅ **Debugging guidance** - Specific steps to investigate further
✅ **Context awareness** - Task relationships and dependencies
✅ **Severity assessment** - Prioritize which failures to address first

## Performance Considerations

### Minimal Overhead
- Error reporting only triggers on failures
- Output formatting is efficient string operations
- No additional API calls or heavy processing

### Controlled Output
- Command output limited to 10 lines for readability
- Stack traces limited to top 3 entries
- Structured format prevents information overload

### Memory Efficient
- Uses StringBuilder for string concatenation
- Processes output line-by-line
- No large object retention

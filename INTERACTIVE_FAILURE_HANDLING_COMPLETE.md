# Interactive Failure Handling for Planning Mode - Complete

## Feature Overview

Added interactive prompts when tasks fail in planning mode, giving users control over execution flow. When a task fails, the system now prompts the user with options to continue, stop, or retry, making the planning process more user-friendly and controllable.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Execution Flow Enhancement

**Location:** `PlanningService.java:149-164`

**Enhanced Logic:**
```java
// Handle task failure
if (!result.isSuccess()) {
    boolean shouldContinue = promptUserOnTaskFailure(subTask, result);
    if (!shouldContinue) {
        System.out.println("🛑 Execution stopped by user choice.");
        execution.setStatus(PlanExecution.ExecutionStatus.FAILED);
        plan.setStatus(ExecutionPlan.PlanStatus.FAILED);
        return execution;
    }
    
    // Check if we need to replan
    if (result.isShouldReplan()) {
        log.info("Replanning required for subtask: {}", subTask.getId());
        replanFromStep(plan, execution, subTask);
    }
}
```

### 2. Interactive User Prompt

**Function:** `promptUserOnTaskFailure()` - Lines 2680-2742

**Features:**
- **Failure Context Display**: Shows what task failed and why
- **Clear Options**: Presents 3 clear choices to the user
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts numbers, letters, or full words
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid input gracefully
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear prompts and feedback

### 3. Retry Handling System

**Function:** `handleTaskRetry()` - Lines 2744-2792

**Retry Options:**
- **Quick Retry**: Immediate retry without changes
- **Manual Fix**: Pause for user to fix issues manually
- **Skip**: Give up on the task and continue

## User Experience

### When a Task Fails

The user will see a comprehensive failure prompt:

```
⚠️  TASK FAILURE DETECTED
════════════════════════════════════════
📋 Failed Task: Install backend dependencies for Express and SQLite
🔧 Priority: CRITICAL
⚡ Complexity: SIMPLE

🎯 What happened:
├─ Action: Install Express dependencies for the backend
├─ Success: ❌ FAILED
└─ Observation: npm install failed because package.json was not found

🤔 What would you like to do?

1️⃣  Continue - Skip this task and proceed with remaining tasks
2️⃣  Stop - Halt execution to investigate and fix the issue
3️⃣  Retry - Attempt this task again (if you fixed the issue)

👉 Enter your choice (1=Continue, 2=Stop, 3=Retry): 
```

### Option 1: Continue
```
✅ Continuing with next task...
```
- **Behavior**: Skips the failed task and proceeds with remaining tasks
- **Use Case**: When the failed task is not critical or you want to see other failures first

### Option 2: Stop
```
🛑 Stopping execution for manual investigation...
```
- **Behavior**: Halts execution completely
- **Use Case**: When you need to investigate and fix the issue before proceeding

### Option 3: Retry
```
🔄 Retrying the failed task...

🔧 Retry Options:

1️⃣  Quick Retry - Retry the task immediately
2️⃣  Manual Fix - Wait for you to fix issues, then retry
3️⃣  Skip - Give up on this task and continue

👉 Retry method (1=Quick, 2=Manual Fix, 3=Skip): 
```

#### Retry Sub-Options

**Quick Retry:**
```
⚡ Performing quick retry...
```
- Immediately retries the task without changes

**Manual Fix:**
```
🔧 Manual Fix Mode:
├─ Please fix the issue in another terminal
├─ Check the error details above
├─ Verify file paths, permissions, and dependencies
└─ Press Enter when ready to retry...
👉 
```
- Pauses execution for manual intervention
- Waits for user to press Enter before retrying

**Skip:**
```
⏭️  Skipping failed task and continuing...
```
- Gives up on the retry and continues with next tasks

## Input Flexibility

### Accepted Input Formats

| Option | Accepted Inputs |
|--------|----------------|
| **Continue** | `1`, `c`, `continue` |
| **Stop** | `2`, `s`, `stop` |
| **Retry** | `3`, `r`, `retry` |

### Retry Sub-Options

| Option | Accepted Inputs |
|--------|----------------|
| **Quick Retry** | `1`, `q`, `quick` |
| **Manual Fix** | `2`, `m`, `manual` |
| **Skip** | `3`, `s`, `skip` |

### Error Handling
```
❌ Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, or 3 (or 'continue', 'stop', 'retry')
```
- Clear error messages for invalid input
- Continuous prompting until valid input is received
- Graceful handling of input exceptions

## Integration with Existing Features

✅ **Debugging suggestions provided**

### Works with Plan Execution Status
✅ **Proper status updates** when execution is stopped
✅ **Execution continues correctly** when user chooses to continue
✅ **Plan state management** maintains consistency

### Maintains Logging
✅ **All decisions logged** at appropriate levels
✅ **User choices recorded** for debugging

## Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Critical Dependency Missing
```
🎯 Working on: Install Node.js dependencies [CRITICAL]
❌ Step failed: npm command not found

🚨 SUBTASK FAILURE REPORT
[... detailed error analysis ...]

🔧 Priority: CRITICAL

👉 Enter your choice (1=Continue, 2=Stop, 3=Retry): 2
🛑 Stopping execution for manual investigation...
```

### Scenario 2: Non-Critical File Creation Issue

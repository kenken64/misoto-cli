# Subtask Failure Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified

The enhanced planning system was experiencing a critical issue where all subtasks were failing during execution. The symptoms were:

1. **All subtasks showing the same generic action**: "Creating project directory structure for the Todo app"
2. **ReAct cycles failing repeatedly** with the same action description
3. **No actual progress** being made on specific subtask goals
4. **Empty working memory** with no files created

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the logs and code, I identified the primary issue in the `performAction` method of `PlanningService.java`:

### Issue 1: Generic Example in Action Prompt

**Location:** `PlanningService.java:275-280`

**Problem:** The action prompt contained a generic example that the AI was copying verbatim instead of generating specific actions for each subtask:

```java
Example for creating a directory:
ACTION_TYPE: SHELL_COMMAND
ACTION_DESCRIPTION: Creating project directory structure for the Todo app
PARAMETERS: command=mkdir -p todoApp/frontend todoApp/backend, working_directory=.
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Directory structure will be created
```

**Result:** The AI was using this exact example for every subtask, regardless of the specific requirements.

### Issue 2: Inadequate Action Context

**Problem:** The action prompt wasn't providing enough context about the current subtask, leading to generic responses.

### Issue 3: Poor Error Handling in Action Parsing

**Problem:** The `parseActionSpec` method was using `valueOf()` without proper error handling, which could cause exceptions.

### Issue 4: Insufficient Field Parsing for Complex Content

**Problem:** The field parsing couldn't handle multi-line content properly, which is needed for file content parameters.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Action Prompt

**File:** `PlanningService.java:255-288`

**Changes:**
- Removed the generic example that was being copied
- Added specific context about the current subtask
- Emphasized the need for specific, tailored actions
- Provided clear rules for different action types
- Added explicit instructions to avoid generic descriptions

**New Prompt Structure:**
```java
String actionPrompt = String.format("""
    Based on your reasoning analysis above, you need to take ONE SPECIFIC ACTION now.
    
    REASONING CONTEXT: %s
    CURRENT SUBTASK: %s
    SUBTASK GOAL: %s
    
    Choose the MOST APPROPRIATE action type for this specific subtask and provide exact parameters.
    
    IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. Choose action type that directly accomplishes the current subtask goal
    2. For file creation: Use FILE_WRITE with complete file content
    3. For directory creation: Use SHELL_COMMAND with mkdir commands
    4. For dependency installation: Use SHELL_COMMAND with npm/pip/etc commands
    5. Be specific - avoid generic descriptions
    6. Ensure parameters are complete and executable
    
    Take action NOW for subtask: %s
    """, reasoning, subTask.getId(), subTask.getDescription(), subTask.getDescription());
```

### Fix 2: Improved Error Handling in Action Parsing

**File:** `PlanningService.java:763-802`

**Changes:**
- Added try-catch block for `valueOf()` to handle unknown action types
- Added better logging and debugging information
- Added specific handling for different action types with informative output

**Implementation:**
```java
AgentTask.TaskType taskType;
String actionTypeStr = fields.getOrDefault("ACTION_TYPE", "AI_ANALYSIS");
try {
    taskType = AgentTask.TaskType.valueOf(actionTypeStr);
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    log.warn("Unknown action type '{}', defaulting to AI_ANALYSIS", actionTypeStr);
    taskType = AgentTask.TaskType.AI_ANALYSIS;
}
```

### Fix 3: Enhanced Field Parsing for Multi-line Content

**File:** `PlanningService.java:713-751`

**Changes:**
- Implemented proper multi-line field parsing
- Added support for content that spans multiple lines
- Improved handling of complex parameters like file content

**Implementation:**
```java
private Map<String, String> parseFields(String block) {
    Map<String, String> fields = new HashMap<>();
    String[] lines = block.split("\n");
    
    String currentField = null;
    StringBuilder currentValue = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (String line : lines) {
        if (line.contains(":") && (line.startsWith("ACTION_TYPE:") || 
                                 line.startsWith("ACTION_DESCRIPTION:") || 
                                 line.startsWith("PARAMETERS:") || 
                                 line.startsWith("EXPECTED_OUTCOME:"))) {
            // Save previous field and start new field
            if (currentField != null) {
                fields.put(currentField, currentValue.toString().trim());
            }
            String[] parts = line.split(":", 2);
            if (parts.length == 2) {
                currentField = parts[0].trim();
                currentValue = new StringBuilder(parts[1].trim());
            }
        } else if (currentField != null && !line.trim().isEmpty()) {
            // Continue multi-line field
            if (currentValue.length() > 0) {
                currentValue.append("\n");
            }
            currentValue.append(line.trim());
        }
    }
    
    // Save last field
    if (currentField != null) {
        fields.put(currentField, currentValue.toString().trim());
    }
    
    return fields;
}
```

### Fix 4: Enhanced Success Evaluation with Debugging

**File:** `PlanningService.java:376-441`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging subtask failures
- Improved success evaluation criteria
- Added detailed failure reporting to help identify issues
- Combined action success with AI evaluation for more accurate assessment

**Key Improvements:**
```java
boolean success = response.toLowerCase().contains("yes") && actionResult.isSuccess();

// Detailed failure reporting
if (!success) {
    System.out.println("❌ Subtask Failed - " + subTask.getDescription());
    System.out.println("   Action Success: " + actionResult.isSuccess());
    System.out.println("   AI Evaluation: " + (response.toLowerCase().contains("yes") ? "YES" : "NO"));
    if (actionResult.getResult() != null && actionResult.getResult().getOutput() != null) {
        System.out.println("   Output: " + actionResult.getResult().getOutput());
    }
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

With these fixes implemented, the enhanced planning system should now:

### ✅ Generate Specific Actions
- Each subtask will generate unique, specific actions
- Actions will be tailored to the individual subtask requirements
- No more generic "Creating project directory structure" for all tasks

### ✅ Execute Proper Commands
- Directory creation will use appropriate `mkdir` commands
- File creation will use `FILE_WRITE` with complete content
- Dependency installation will use proper package manager commands
- Each action will have the correct parameters for execution

### ✅ Provide Better Debugging
- Clear logging of action types and parameters
- Detailed failure reporting when subtasks don't succeed
- Better visibility into what actions are being attempted

### ✅ Handle Complex Content
- Multi-line file content can be properly parsed
- Complex parameter structures are supported
- Better error handling prevents crashes from malformed responses

## Testing the Fix

### Build and Test
```bash
# Compile the fixes
./mvnw clean compile -DskipTests

# Test with a simple planning request
java -jar target/misoto-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ask "Create a simple todo app with React frontend and Node.js backend"
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Subtask 1**: Should create specific directory structure (e.g., `mkdir -p todo-app-backend`)
2. **Subtask 2**: Should initialize npm project (e.g., `npm init -y`)
3. **Subtask 3**: Should install dependencies (e.g., `npm install express sqlite3`)
4. **Subtask 4**: Should create specific files with complete content
5. **Subtask 5**: Should set up React frontend with proper commands

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Each subtask shows different, specific action descriptions
- ✅ Commands are actually executable and appropriate
- ✅ Files are created with complete, working content
- ✅ Progress is made through the full application setup
- ✅ Working memory shows actual results and created files

## Validation Checklist

When testing the fixed system, verify:

- [ ] Each subtask generates a unique action description
- [ ] Shell commands are specific and executable
- [ ] File operations include complete file paths and content
- [ ] Action types match the subtask requirements
- [ ] Parameters are properly parsed and complete
- [ ] Success evaluation works correctly
- [ ] Failed subtasks show clear error information
- [ ] Progress is actually made toward the goal

## Impact

These fixes address the core issue that was preventing the enhanced planning system from working effectively. The system should now:

1. **Generate Working Plans**: Each subtask will have actionable, specific steps
2. **Execute Successfully**: Actions will be properly formatted and executable
3. **Provide Clear Feedback**: Users will see exactly what's being attempted and why things succeed or fail
4. **Make Real Progress**: The system will actually create files, directories, and complete development tasks

The enhanced planning system should now function as designed, generating comprehensive, tutorial-quality development plans that can be successfully executed to create working applications.

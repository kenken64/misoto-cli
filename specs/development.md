# Claude Code CLI - Development Status and Roadmap

## Current Development Status

### Release Phase

Claude Code is currently in **Research Preview** (Beta) status. This indicates:

- Early access to the core functionality
- Active development with frequent updates
- Some features may have limitations
- Collecting user feedback for improvement
- Not recommended for critical production use

### Version History

| Version | Release Date | Key Features |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 0.2.29 | Current | Latest stable version |
| 0.2.x | Various | Incremental improvements and bug fixes |
| 0.1.x | Initial | Initial research preview release |

### Known Limitations

1. **Tool Execution Reliability**
   - Some complex command sequences may not execute reliably
   - Environment-specific command behavior variations

2. **Long-Running Commands**
   - Limited support for commands that run for extended periods
   - Potential timeout issues for certain operations

3. **Terminal Rendering**
   - Some advanced terminal formatting may not render correctly
   - Limited support for interactive terminal applications

4. **Self-Knowledge**
   - The agent may sometimes misunderstand its own capabilities
   - Inconsistent awareness of feature limitations

   - Nice-to-have convenience features

### Feedback Incorporation Process

1. User feedback collected via `/bug` and `/feedback` commands
2. Issues tracked and prioritized in GitHub issue tracker
3. Recurring patterns identified across user reports
4. Feature requests assessed for alignment with product vision
5. Selected improvements incorporated into development sprints

## Development Principles

### Design Philosophy

- **Natural Interaction**: Prioritize natural language understanding over command syntax
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain and utilize conversation and codebase context
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fail gracefully with helpful error messages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works everywhere, advanced features where supported

### Quality Standards

- Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
- Regular security audits and dependency reviews
- Performance benchmarking against established targets
- Usability testing with representative user workflows

### Release Cadence

- Major feature releases: Every 2-3 months
- Bug fix and minor improvement releases: Every 2-4 weeks
- Critical fixes: As needed

## Getting Involved
